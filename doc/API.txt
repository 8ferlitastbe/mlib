Evolution of the API
--------------------

V0.1.*: * First formal version of API

V0.2.*: * worker_sync takes a 'worker_t' as an additional parameter
	(This allows to perform a wait-on-event instead of a busy waiting). 
	* worker_init takes an int as numWorker instead of an unsingned int.
	* RBTREE pop method has been renamed into _pop_at
        * SNAPSHOT_DEF has been removed. use SNAPSHOT_SPSC_DEF
        * array's _set_at2 has been replaced by array's _get_at.
        The interface is similar to dict _get_at, making the API cleaner
        and more generic.
            _set_at2(a,i,x) ==> set(*_get_at(a,i),x)
        * DICT SET _set_at method has been renamed as _push
        Since there is no key, it is a push method, not a _set_at method.
        * DICT_SET_DEF2 ==> DICT_SET_DEF
        since it only requires one argument.
