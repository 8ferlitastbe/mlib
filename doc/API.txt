API incompatibility
-------------------

V0.1.*: * First formal version of API

V0.2.*: * worker_start takes a 'worker_t' as an additional parameter
	(This allows to perform a wait-on-event instead of a busy waiting).
        * worker_spawn doesn't take into a 'worker_t' anymore.
	* worker_init takes an int as numWorker instead of an unsingned int.
	* RBTREE pop method has been renamed into _pop_at
        * SNAPSHOT_DEF has been removed. use SNAPSHOT_SPSC_DEF
        * array's _set_at2 has been replaced by array's _get_at.
        The interface is similar to dict _get_at, making the API cleaner
        and more generic.
            _set_at2(a,i,x) ==> set(*_get_at(a,i),x)
        * Rename DICT SET _set_at method as _push
        Since there is no key, it is a push method, not a _set_at method.
        * Rename DICT_SET_DEF2 as DICT_SET_DEF
        since it only requires one argument.
        * Rename ALGO _contains as _contain_p
        since it is a predicate '_p' and it shall be in infinitive form.
        * Rename algo _map as _for_each (Standard name).
        * M_PRINT_ARG & M_FPRINT_ARG don't put a final semicolon at the end
        of their expansion anymore (cleaner and no longer needed with the
        new available tools).
        * For the TUPLE and the VARIANT
        change name of _get_ ## field into _get_at_ ## fields
        Since there is a name collision with other methods
        if a field is named 'str'.
        * Rename _remove into _erase for dictionary & B+TREE (adding a compatibility layer) for API uniformization.
        The provided _remove doesn't use an iterator but a 'key', incompatible with the one of array or list.
        But is like the one provided by the priority queue.
